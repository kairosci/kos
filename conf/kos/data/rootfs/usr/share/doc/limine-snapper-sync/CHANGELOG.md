## 1.30.1 - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- `MAX_SNAPSHOT_ENTRIES` falls back to `auto` when unset.

## 1.30.0 - 2026-06-04

### Changed

- `MAX_SNAPSHOT_ENTRIES` defaults to auto mode. Logs a console warning when older entries are pruned.
- `FS_UUID` is auto-configured if not set.
- Improved detection of invalid config when `FS_UUID` is manually set by the user.
- `ROOT_SUBVOLUME_PATH` and `ROOT_SNAPSHOTS_PATH` are auto-configured if not explicitly set.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where pacman lock cleanup could fail on fast startup in certain cases.

## 1.29.0 - 2026-05-19

### Added

- New `--add <ID>` option to prevent out-of-sync issues when many snapshots are added in a very short time.
- Thread pool with 5 threads for readers and writers to allow parallel execution and reduce sync time.
- `limine-snapper-restore`: auto-detects a COSMIC terminal when `TERMINAL` is not set.

### Changed

- Move the 3rd manifest backup location from `/var/lib/limine/snapshots.json` to
  `/var/cache/boot/<machine-id>/lss/snapshots.json` for more consistent backup restoration.
- Renamed the pacman hook script limine-snapper-lock; it now uses the shared mutex library instead of its own mutex
  implementation.
- Simplified CLI output and restore messages.
- Bump GraalVM build tool and jackson-databind versions.

### Removed

- snapper plugin: Removed the 1-second delay when adding a snapshot, reducing wait time before adding the next snapshot,

## 1.28.0 - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Auth helper avoids manually typing `sudo` for each CLI command in any terminal by using configured `AUTH_METHOD`

  for [gzip decompression](https://github.com/Limine-Bootloader/Limine/blob/v12.x/CONFIG.md#paths).
- Warn about unsupported Limine path resources (e.g. `hdd()`, `odd()`) and skip invalid snapshot image creation.

## 1.27.0 - 2026-04-25

### Added

- `EXCLUDE_SNAPSHOT_ENTRIES` allows excluding kernel entries from newly created snapshots.
- `limine-snapper-info` shows which kernel entries or snapshot types are excluded.
- Case-insensitive matching of "Snapshots" entry is allowed (e.g. `//+snapshots`)
- Safeguards for snapshot entry creation:
    * Skip invalid snapshot-like entry names(e.g. `//my snapshots` or `//snapshot menu`) to avoid recursive or
      duplicate entries.
    * Skip backup-like entry names(e.g. `//Backup`), which are excluded from snapshot entries by default.

### Changed

- Reuse the "Snapshots" node in LimineWriter instead of searching for it again.
- Simplify tree node lookup logic.

### Fixed

- Entry names containing macros are resolved to their clean equivalent.
- Fixed ESP path detection for bootctl output containing multiple lines.
- Merge stderr into stdout for subprocess output instead of separate streams.

## 1.26.0 - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Pre- / post-hook mechanism allows custom scripts to run before and after kernel management and limine.conf updates.

### Deprecated

- The inflexible config options `COMMANDS_BEFORE_SAVE` and `COMMANDS_AFTER_SAVE` are deprecated in favor of the hook
  mechanism and will be removed in a future major release.

- Automatic recovery from the 3rd backup if two manifest files on the FAT32 boot partition are corrupted due to
  hardware issues, unexpected power loss, or user errors.

### Changed

- Use native Files API instead of external commands (cp, mv, rm) for file operations.
- Simplified error and info messages for clarity.
- Bump GraalVM build tool and jackson-databind versions.

### Fixed

- `limine-snapper-info`: **FS UUID** is no longer highlighted in red after initialization when no snapshot entries
  exist, reducing user confusion.

## 1.24.0 - 2026-03-25

### Added

- `limine-snapper-info`: Verify files in parallel using multiple threads to reduce execution time.
- `limine-snapper-restore`: Add additional fallback terminals when `TERMINAL` is not set and no default terminal apps
  are available.

### Changed

- Bump GraalVM build tool and jackson-databind versions.

## 1.23.1 - 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- Disable snapper's D-Bus option when running in a chroot environment.
- `limine-snapper-notify`: Only parse required configuration options instead of loading all key=value pairs.

## 1.23.0 - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Add `limine-snapper-remove` to remove Limine snapshot boot entries and free up space on the boot partition.
- Support an `auto` mode for `MAX_SNAPSHOT_ENTRIES`, which automatically deletes snapshot boot entries based on
  `LIMIT_USAGE_PERCENT`.
- Implement debounce mechanism to group many simultaneous snapshot deletions into a single sync, improving efficiency.
- Warn users if an OS entry lacks the required kernel command line needed for snapshot boot.

### Removed

- Remove the deprecated `LIMIT_NUMBER` config option, as it is redundant with `MAX_SNAPSHOT_ENTRIES`

### Fixed

- Remove redundant optional `dunst` dependency (upstream changes broke compatibility). Use `libnotify` instead, as
  `dunst` itself depends on `libnotify`.
- Ensure correct log order when multiple logger processes run concurrently by waiting for each to finish.

## 1.22.2 - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- Auto-update OS snapshot name to match the main OS entry name when it is outside a `/Snapshots` menu.

- Preserve CLI progress output (e.g. rsync) by streaming bytes instead of lines.

## 1.22.0 - 2026-01-31

### Added

- `limine-snapper-info`: displays which snapshot IDs are affected by corrupted or missing files.

    * Runs as a native executable, no JRE required.
    * Performance improved by over 2.4x at runtime.

### Fixed

- Corrected the logo icon resolution to 128×128 for GNOME.
- `limine-snapper-info`: hides "Last snapshot" if no snapshots exist during initialization.

## 1.21.0 - 2026-01-24

### Added

- Automatically determine the default OS name from `PRETTY_NAME` or `NAME` in `/etc/os-release` when `TARGET_OS_NAME` is
  not set.
- Provide more details about boot partition usage so that non-technical users could understand why the limit is
  exceeded.

### Changed

- Rename the configuration option `UUID` to `FS_UUID` for clarity, as `UUID` is too generic and could refer to a
  filesystem, GPT, or backup filesystem. The old `UUID` remains for backward compatibility.
- The `inotify-tools` package is no longer required; the snapper plugin is used instead.

### Fixed

- Abort sync immediately if `snapper list-configs` fails in a chroot environment.

## 1.20.0 - 2026-01-15

- Automatically disable colored log output on terminals without color support.
- `limine-snapper-info`: Skip file hashing when required hash functions are missing.
- `limine-snapper-restore`: Exit with status code 0 instead of 1 when canceled.

## 1.19.1 - 2026-01-04

### Fixed or improved

- Terminal input reader (`TerminalReader`):
    * Correctly handles UTF-8 characters
    * Avoids busy-looping CPU while waiting for user input
    * Supports the Delete key

## 1.19.0 - 2026-01-02

### Added

- Implemented a `TerminalReader` that supports arrow keys (Up, Down, Right, Left) for user input.
- `limine-snapper-restore`: Up/Down arrow keys can be used to select a snapshot ID.

### Changed

- Upgraded the `jackson-databind` dependency from v2 to v3 for JSON reading/writing.

### Fixed

- `limine-snapper-list`: Table formatting falls back to ASCII when Unicode is not available in TTY.

## 1.18.1 - 2025-12-12

### Fixed

- Return exit code 0 instead of 1 when a restore operation is intentionally aborted.
- Display an informational message indicating **which restore method will be used** before the restore process begins.
- Add comments marking where snapshot entries were generated, improving transparency and preventing unintended manual
  edits of auto-generated entries in limine.conf

## 1.18.0 - 2025-11-27

### Added

- **3rd restore method:** `opensuse` (`snapper`), supporting native `snapper rollback <id>` on OpenSUSE-style layouts.
- Automatic Btrfs layout validation according to your restore method configuration. If the layout is invalid, snapshot
  creation is stopped to prevent user errors.
- If a hash mismatch is detected more than 3 times, Btrfs root and home subvolumes are automatically set to read-only
  to prevent further metadata corruption caused by serious non-ECC RAM faults.

### Changed

- The config option `ENABLE_RSYNC_ASK="yes|no"` has been replaced with `RESTORE_METHOD="rsync|replace|opensuse"`.

## 1.17.1 - 2025-10-28

### Fixed and improved

- Avoid showing "null" when no snapshot description is available in Snapper boot entry comments.
- Show snapshot count and limit in the "Snapshots" boot entry comment to clarify separate limit settings in Snapper and
  Limine-snapper-sync and prevent user confusion.

## 1.17.0 - 2025-10-26

### Added

- Ability to replace an entire kernel command line using `SNAPSHOT_KERNEL_PARAMETERS=` (for multiple-profile UKIs).

### Changed

- Switched to the standard Java library for detecting filesystem types instead of relying on `findmnt`.
- Updated the Maven dependency for JSON reading/writing.

### Fixed

- `limine-snapper-restore` now finds an ID in the last `subvol=` flag in a kernel command line rather than the first,
  when multiple `subvol=` flags are present.
- `limine-snapper-list` no longer crashes if a snapshot has no description.

## 1.16.2 - 2025-10-18

### Fixed

- Avoid aborting restore if child subvolume paths have unexpected or special characters.
- Moving `limine.conf.tmp` to `limine.conf` **before** starting `sync` to ensure a complete write on FAT32
  (**not after**)

### Fixed or improved

- Improved reliability of the Snapper plugin across different environments.
    * Simplified the `run_sync()` logic.
    * Added checks to ensure some standard core commands are available before use.
    * Ensured safe fallback behavior on non-systemd systems and minimal environments when the core commands are missing.
- Prevent process cancellation when `MAX_SNAPSHOT_ENTRIES` is invalid by using the default fallback value.
- Added a warning to make users aware that the Snapper snapshot limit and `MAX_SNAPSHOT_ENTRIES` are separate settings
  to prevent confusion about snapshot counts.
    * This warning disappears when `MAX_SNAPSHOT_ENTRIES` is set to any value other than the default.

## 1.16.0 - 2025-10-10

### Added

- Handle read-only root subvolume during restoration:
    * Stop `rsync` restoration process
    * For Btrfs, automatically make the subvolume writable so the restore can continue
- Added Snapper plugin:
    * Automatically triggered by Snapper to run `limine-snapper-sync` directly
    * Using the service `limine-snapper-sync.service` or `limine-snapper-watcher` is no longer required (they are
      now optional)
- New configuration option `SET_SNAPSHOT_AS_DEFAULT` to control whether a restored snapshot's subvolume becomes the
  default.

### Changed

- Disabled the timeout for the restoration prompt notification

## 1.15.0 - 2025-09-18

### Added

- Support for `SNAPSHOT_KERNEL_PARAMETERS+` to add extra kernel parameters dynamically
- Support for `SNAPSHOT_KERNEL_PARAMETERS-` to remove specific kernel parameters dynamically

### Changed

- Switched from checking supported Limine major versions to explicitly checking unsupported Limine major versions

### Removed

- Removed unnecessary tool name from version info output in `limine-snapper-info`

## 1.13.0 - 2025-08-07

### Added

- Support for snapshot boot entries with nested subkernels, allowing defining multiple boot profiles.<br>
  Compatible with limine-entry-tool v2: multiple cmdlines per kernel entry are supported.

### Changed

- Simplified XML writing by generating raw strings instead of Java XML libraries.

## 1.12.1 - 2025-07-25

### Fixed

- Renamed config option `BACKUP_THRESHOLD` to `CONFIG_BACKUP_THRESHOLD` to avoid confusion, as BACKUP is too general.
- If `SPACE_NUMBER` is not set, it now correctly defaults to 5 instead of nothing.

## 1.12.0 - 2025-07-11

### Added

- Provided `/lib/limine/limine-mutex`, a shell library offering `mutex_lock` / `mutex_unlock` functions to help external
  tools safely access `limine.conf` and boot-related files on the same partition, avoiding potential conflicts.

### Changed

- Refactored ConfigReader to handle multiple config files.
- Updated `jackson-databind` dependency from 2.17.0 to 2.19.1.
- Renamed class `LimineHistory` to `Manifest` to reduce confusion.

- Added lockfile `limine-snapper-cleanup.lock` to prevent `limine-snapper-sync` from accessing snapper CLI during
  `snapper-cleanup.service`. Sync runs afterward. (#4)

## 1.11.0 - 2025-06-25

### Added

- New `SNAPSHOT_WRITABLE` option to make created snapshots writable when write access is needed at boot.
- Enhanced `limine-snapper-watcher` to create multiple processes in parallel, improving performance when many snapshots
  are deleted simultaneously.

### Changed

- Simplified `limine-snapper-restore` by merging two redundant terminal-launching functions into one.

### Removed

- Removed the non-atomic lock file `limine-snapper-sync.lock` and replaced it with the atomic mutex `limine-global.lock`
  for reliable concurrency control.

### Fixed

- Prevented unnecessary repeated writes to `limine.conf` when multiple snapshots are deleted simultaneously.
- Sync aborts immediately during Snapper snapshot deletion if target OS name is missing in `limine.conf`,
  preventing unintended deletion of bootable files.
- Fixed incorrect version information displayed during JSON format upgrade.

## 1.10.1 - 2025-06-10

### Fixed

* Missing `@JsonIgnore` on `snapshotLine` field, which was unintentionally serialized to JSON.

## 1.10.0 - 2025-06-10

### Added

* `limine-snapper-restore`: auto-detects `kitty` terminal (by @dianaw353)
* Secondary parsing of snapshot entries from JSON to Limine entries when `allInSnapshotConfig` is not used — this is
  preparation for version 2.

### Changed

* Updated JSON format in preparation for the upcoming version 2.0.0:
    - `SnapshotEntry`: Removed redundant `name` field.
    - `KernelEntry`: Removed unused `orderNumber`.
    - `ImageDetail`: Replaced `espDirPath` with `dirPath`.
    - `CmdlineDetail`: Removed two redundant `parameters` fields.
    - Renamed `lineOrderNumber` to `lineIndex` in all entry types.

## 1.9.5 - 2025-05-18

### Fixed

* Restricted access to the temporary config file `/tmp/limine-snapper-sync.conf` for security reasons.
    - As an exception, only `limine-snapper-restore` is allowed to read this config file if all conditions are met:
        - Booted from a read-only Btrfs snapshot without overlayfs.
        - A valid Snapper snapshot path is detected.
        - The config file is owned by the root user.

## 1.9.4 - 2025-05-16

### Fixed

* Sync cached writes to FAT32 to prevent data loss in case of power failure or forced shutdown.
* Don't touch an OS entry with the same name if its machine-ID does not match and no identical OS entry is found.
* Fixed restore for Btrfs root partition without a root subvolume using `rsync`.

## 1.9.3 - 2025-05-10

### Fixed or improved

* When booting from a read-only Btrfs system, `/etc/default/limine` is automatically copied to `/tmp/limine`,
  allowing configuration.
* `QUIET_MODE=yes` to hide all success messages and reduce log spam. This applies only to `limine-snapper-sync`.
* Automatically removes the `//Snapshots` entry if no snapshots are present, preventing boot panic when selecting this
  entry.
* Increased the default usage limit from 80% to 85%.

## 1.9.2 - 2025-04-26

### Fixed

* Replaced unsafe `source` with key-value parsing when loading config files in the restore script.

  `kitty`, etc.).

## 1.9.1 - 2025-04-21

### Fixed or improved

* Improved snapshot information formatting in `limine-snapper-info` for clearer display of usage and limits.

## 1.8.5 - 2025-03-21

### Fixed or improved

* Renamed systemd service`limine-snapper-watcher.service` to `limine-snapper-sync.service` to avoid confusion.
* Removed unnecessary `echo` in a loop while waiting for a Snapper process to finish before starting a Pacman upgrade.

## 1.8.4 - 2025-03-16

### Fixed

* Switched local time to standard UTC time globally.
  This prevents unintended deletion of all snapshot entries due to inconsistent time across different time zones.
* Enforced setting the current JSON format version when saving `snapshots.json` to avoid inconsistencies between
  different LSS versions.

## 1.8.3 - 2025-03-08

### Fixed or improved

* Enhanced protection against accidental deletion of all snapshot entries due to user error.
* Made replacing the kernel cmdline with its snapshotted cmdline more reliable to ignore misconfiguration of users.
* Improved verification of `ROOT_SUBVOLUME_PATH` and `ROOT_SNAPSHOTS_PATH` before creating a snapshot.
  This ensures the correct configuration when restoring from a snapshot.
* Reduced message code and removed some unnecessary code.
* Prevented any terminal GUI from closing automatically in case of a restore failure.

## 1.8.2 - 2025-03-06

### Fixed

* A broken cmdline will be forcibly replaced with a valid cmdline during restore to create a "backup" entry and prevent
  interruption.
* Keep any terminal GUI open on restore failure instead of closing automatically.
* Skip `reboot` command if it is not available after restore.
* Prompt for OS name if not found before starting restore.
* Allow updating `snapshots.json` when an ESP usage limit is exceeded, but do not update the last Snapper ID.

## 1.8.1 - 2025-03-01

### Improved
